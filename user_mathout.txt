Hello. Type in your name. Jim

Welcome back, Jim.
Let's play a math game.
We will start with finding the area of your home's lot.
Example: A lot has a length=6ft and width=2ft. These values are then multipled to find the area.
The area of the lot for this example is 12 feet.

What is the length of your lot in feet? 85
What is the width of your lot in feet? 112
Using the same approach as the example, the area of your lot is 9520 feet.

That was fun. Let's explore some functions in the math module.

The function math.comb(x,y) will return the number of ways to choose y items from x items without reptition and without order.
math.comb(5,1) = 5

The function math.perm(x,y) will return the number of ways to choose y items from x items without reptition and without order.
math.perm(5,1) = 5

The function math.ceil(x) will return the the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
math.ceil(12.57) = 13

The function math.fabs(x) will return the absolute value of x.
math.fabs(12.57) = 12.57

The function math.cbrt(x) will return the cube root of x.
math.cbrt(12.57) = 2.325118504770232

The function math.exp2(x) will return 2 to the power of x.
math.exp2(7) = 128.0

I hope you enjoyed learning about some of the many available math functions. 
Since you like puzzles, here are some math functions related to your puzzles domain.

PUZZLE 1
--------
What is the average size of a jigsaw puzzle you work on at any given time? 450
What is the number of jigsaw puzzles you complete each year? 135
The average number of puzzle pieces you play each year is 60750 pieces.


PUZZLE 2
--------
Here is another one for you. We surveyed a group of people to see if they play at least one puzzle daily.
The number of people surveyed was 837. Of those surveyed, 362 said they play at least one puzzle daily.
The percentage of those surveyed who play a puzzle daily is 0.43%.


PUZZLE 3
--------
Our final puzzle involves the total time to complete one puzzle each day over 7 days.
We compare the SUM function and MATH.FSUM function to compare reults on the same data set.
The data set for 7 days in minute values via a stopwatch: 14.1, 9.4, 13.7, 21.2, 11.4, 12.5, 16.2

The sum total is 98.50000000000001.

The floating point sum is 98.5.
